# AwakenedAI-Web Development Log

## Day 5 (March 7, 2025)

### Summary:
Based on yesterday's decision, we split the project into 2 repos, Processing and Web. By the end of the session we succeeded in catching the web version up to the cli trial version"

Today's activities:
- Created Web Repo (AwakenedAI-Web) 
- Set up Next.js project structure with TypeScript
- Implemented basic search UI components
- Created API routes for vector search and completion
- Integrated with Supabase for vector retrieval
- Connected OpenAI API for response generation
- Successfully matched CLI functionality in web interface

### Biggest Challenge:
The bot was not able to find any context, and we spent a lot of time trying to replicate the functionality of the CLI version. After the ai did it very differently on first attempt, we moved the processing repo into the web repo, so that a fresh ai session could reference it for help
